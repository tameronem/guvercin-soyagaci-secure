# Mobile Pedigree Tree Fix Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Updated Coordinate Calculation Method
- **Before**: Used `offsetLeft/offsetTop` which gave relative positions to the offset parent
- **After**: Now uses `getBoundingClientRect()` which provides accurate viewport-based positioning

### 2. Specific Code Changes in `drawConnectionLines()` function:

#### Added SVG pointer-events handling:
```javascript
svg.style.pointerEvents = 'none';
```

#### Updated coordinate calculations:
```javascript
// OLD CODE:
const nodeX = node.offsetLeft + node.offsetWidth;
const nodeY = node.offsetTop + node.offsetHeight / 2;

// NEW CODE:
const nodeRect = node.getBoundingClientRect();
const nodeX = nodeRect.right - svgRect.left;
const nodeY = nodeRect.top + nodeRect.height / 2 - svgRect.top;
```

#### Similar updates for father and mother connections:
```javascript
// Father connection
const fatherRect = father.getBoundingClientRect();
const fatherX = fatherRect.left - svgRect.left;
const fatherY = fatherRect.top + fatherRect.height / 2 - svgRect.top;

// Mother connection
const motherRect = mother.getBoundingClientRect();
const motherX = motherRect.left - svgRect.left;
const motherY = motherRect.top + motherRect.height / 2 - svgRect.top;
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **CSS Transform Support**: `getBoundingClientRect()` automatically accounts for CSS transforms like scale, rotate, etc.
2. **Scroll Position Handling**: The method includes scroll positions in its calculations
3. **Media Query Compatibility**: Works correctly with different CSS layouts triggered by media queries
4. **Mobile Layout Support**: Properly handles flexbox direction changes and responsive layouts

## Testing

The existing event listeners (scroll, resize, orientationchange) already call `drawConnectionLines()`, so they will now work correctly with the new coordinate system.

To test:
1. Open the application in desktop view - lines should connect correctly
2. Resize browser to mobile size (< 768px) - lines should remain correctly positioned
3. Test on actual mobile devices - lines should render correctly from initial load
4. Test scrolling and zooming - lines should maintain correct positions

## Note

The fix addresses the root cause identified in the analysis: the mismatch between JavaScript's DOM-based coordinate system and CSS's visual rendering. By using `getBoundingClientRect()`, we now work with the actual rendered positions, ensuring consistency across all viewport sizes and CSS layouts.
